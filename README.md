# titanic-flask

### A web app made with Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

In order to run, execute "python app.py". This will create the DB (if not exists) and will populate it (if empty).

Missing stuff:
- Automatic Tests. In order to manually test it we can use right now tools such as Postman or Swagger.
- Correct the histogram.
- Making the code work also without DB.
