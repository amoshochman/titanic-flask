# titanic-flask

### A web app made with Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

In order to run, execute "python app.py". This will create the DB (if not exists) and will populate it (if empty).

We could split the code into more files but being the shortness of it (~100 lines) I decided to keep it like this to not-overkill.

Missing stuff:
- Automatic Tests. In order to manually test it we can use right now tools such as Postman or Swagger.
- Correct the histogram.
- Making the code work also without DB.
