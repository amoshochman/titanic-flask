# titanic-flask

### A web app made with Flask, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

In order to run, execute "python app.py". In config.ini file, the value for DATA can be either "csv" or "db"

We could split the code into more files but being the shortness of it (~100 lines) I decided to keep it like this to not-overkill.
